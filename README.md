### Flow of the System


#### 1. Create Account

   - Users (tricycle drivers and admin staff) fill out a registration form with the following details:

     - Name

     - Email

     - Password

   - The system validates the information and creates the user account.


#### 2. User Registration and Login

   - Users log in using their registered email and password.


#### 3. Permit Application

   - Tricycle drivers fill out an online application form and upload necessary documents.

   - The system verifies the documents using automated verification processes.


#### 4. Application Review and Approval

   - Admin staff review the application and documents.

   - The system provides status updates to the applicant.


#### 5. Permit Issuance

   - Approved applications result in the issuance of digital permits.

   - Applicants are notified via email/SMS about the approval.


#### 6. Monitoring and Renewal

   - The system tracks permit validity and sends renewal reminders to tricycle drivers.

   - Tricycle drivers can apply for renewal through the system.


#### 7. System View and Data Visualization

   - The system provides a comprehensive view of the total population of tricycle drivers with permits.

   - A color-coded chart displays permit status, with green indicating valid permits and red indicating expired or pending permits.

   - The management of color coding is implemented to provide alternating travel schedules based on permit status color coding (Green, Red).


#### 8. Payment Processing

   - Applicants can pay permit fees online or at designated payment terminals.

   - The system records payment status and updates permit status accordingly.
